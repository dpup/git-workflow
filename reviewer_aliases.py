# Populate this dict. to add aliases to Github handles when adding reviewers to a PR.
# Can also use to blacklist handles.
#
# (If you contribute to git-workflow, you'll probably want to add this file to
# your .gitignore)
#
# Usage:
# aliases = {
#     # this handle is really annoying to remember, so alias it to something easy
#     # (like the person's name)
#     "maia": "a_long_complicated_handle",
#
#     # ugh, this other github user has a really similar handle to my teammate and
#     # I always accidentally request reviews from them; blacklist the handle.
#     "notMyTeammate": None
# }

aliases = {}
